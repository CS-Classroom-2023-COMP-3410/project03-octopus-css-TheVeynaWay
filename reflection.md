My overall process for development was that I wanted to put all of my css code in a seperate file just because I find it easier to follow
the code and understand what's going on. I just started at the top of the page with the header and worked my way down element by element until I finished the page. Overall I didn't have that much trouble but it did take me ahile just because I haven't memorized everything for
css coding so I would have to check notes or search up how to do certain things. Also sometimes it just took some trial and error to try to match things like color, spacing, and text size to the reference image.

The main part that I had trouble with was the quiz section because I was struggling to get the image to go to the right side of the text.
Eventually I came up with the idea of a flex box to achieve this but I had to create a new class to group all the text togethor so it would
treat it as one text element and one image. I also had to set the order of the image so that it went to the right side instead of the left
side. Finally I added the justify to be space between so that the elements were on opposite sides of the quiz section.
